# Recipes Menu
A simple website with a list of recipes to cook. Made as part of the Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes). View [live page](https://neomoon007.github.io/odin-recipes/).
### Expectations
I expected to use my basic HTML and CSS knowledge gained from the first Odin Project lessons and build a very simple website.
